### How can you best utilize these strengths? In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

- Dividing projects based off of our strengths in each area.
- For professional competencies, we can divide up our strengths to suit each member of the team.
If someone is struggling with a specific topic, or want to learn more about one - pair them with a member in
the group who is confident in the topic.

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?0
- team meetups, meeting back up throughout the day.
  - 9AM: Morning Meetup
  - 1PM: Optional check-in
  - 5PM: evening check-in PUSH PARTY!!!

# Conflict Plan

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises? 
- discuss with team member about particular disagreement. 
``` js 
if (disagreement !== resolved) {
    discuss in group and vote on matter at hand;
    discuss overall outcome with group as well;
}
```

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

- Refer to problem #1 of conflict plan. Group intervention!

### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- Treat each challenge with respect to the other member. We will also be working in groups of 2,
with each member having differing strengths and weaknesses to balance out the workload.

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
- Refer to problem #1 again, and ask questions to see if we can help rather than be accusatory.

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

- Go to instructor about the issue and explain. Have all group members present.
